//             and/or mentoring to Professionals (except that inactivity for 180
//             consecutive days may result in deletion of a Experts’ account). Each
//             Expert controls the methods, materials, content and all aspects of

//             collectively the “Expert Package”). Professionals are responsible
//             for selecting the right Experts for their needs. Professionals
//             should review and investigate each Expert's self-reported
//             credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from
//             other Parents and/or Professionals. All coaching and/or mentoring
//             sessions should be supervised by a responsible adult. Each Expert
//             has the sole discretion to accept or decline or continue or
//             discontinue a coaching and/or mentoring relationship with any
//             Professional.

//             employee or other) while these Terms are in effect, including with
//             meKambio’s competitors if desired, provided that such other
//             activities do not require Experts to violate the Terms.
